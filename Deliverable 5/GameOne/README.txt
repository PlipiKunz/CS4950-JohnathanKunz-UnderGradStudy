Overview:
	Game One is the second project I have made.
	It is made using python and the pygame library. 

Controls:
	Left Shift: Run
	Space: Interact
	Arrow Keys: Move

Building an Executable:
	If for some reason you need to build an executable of the game, that
	can be done by running the command "python setup.py build" from the 
	command line in the GameOne directory. For this to work you should have
	Python installed, and should specifically also have pygame, and numpy installed.
	If you do not have numpy or pygame you can run the commands "pip pygame" and 
	"pip numpy" from the command line to download those libraries.
